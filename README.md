# Shoot-The-Dominoes-JMonkeyEngine-

This program/game was a project for my CMSC 325 class in UMGC.

*NOTE: *
When you download the JMonkeyEngine and run the scene, 
make sure to put the textures in the 'assets/Textures/' section of the program.

*GAME DESCRIPTION & INFORMATION: *
The game is all about the player matching the number presented by clicking 
on the dominoes and the number corresponding with the domino is added to the sum. 

For example, the game will tell the player to 
“reach the number: *insert random number*”
And the player must match it. 

And the means to do that is by shooting a row of 6 dominoes, 
but they need to click the right ones since each click adds to the sum. 
The catch is, once you click a domino, the domino disappears. 

The whole game is a puzzle to make sure you click on the right numbers to equal the random generated number presented. 
And to make sure the puzzle works well and there are no errors, the highest number to match would be 21 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6).

All this must be done under a timer represented with a red block going from the right of the screen to the left, 
using the dominoes as endpoints. The player used the left mouse click to click the dominoes, then the right mouse 
click to input the sum. The player will see if they have gotten the sum correctly or not and then is prompted to 
press the spacebar to reset the game. The whole point is to not let the red block reach the other end of the screen. 
When it does the players score will be shown, how many were correct, how many were not.
